In order to contribute towards the development of this project, I would recommend making a mod and uploading it to the mod server in most cases. If I think the mod would be a good fit for the default game, I'll reach out and ask if I can add it. If the thing you want to add does not work as its own mod, then you can make a fork, add the changes there, and then use a pull request to put things onto the main branch.
